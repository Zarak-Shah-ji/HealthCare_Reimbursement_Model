## Overview
This project aims to solve the take home technical assesment from KALDEROS. The main technical question is solving to predict HEALTHCARE REIMBURSMENT CLAIMS using Machine learning specifically using RandomForestClassifier and LogisticRegression.   It includes various files and and 
 10 row very small dataset (this was the trickier part to deal with) that are essential for classification of patients.

# Key Analytical Findings:

- **RandomForestClassifier** for non-linearity handling, feature importance, handling of categorical features, cross-validation performance
Though the very small dataset size made me use LogisticRegression as well for simplicitiy, helping getting clear insights and being less prone to overfitting where RandomForest can overfit on small datasets

- **The data suggests** that younger patients, particularly females, tend to have higher acceptance rates for claims, and lower claim amounts are more likely to be approved.
